You don't have to chip in, but my goal is to make a silly game with inspiration from COD Zombies, Nova Drift, Vampire Survivors, brotato, and Bounty of One.
It's nothing serious, but I have spent about 3 hours, and a lot of that time asking ChatGPT for help. It's 164 mb, I deleted the liberty file because ChatGPT told me to, so hopefully it works for y'all.
I'm gonna get back to working on it tomorrow, so even if you add something small like funny faces on the enemy capsules, I il put it in. (*^3^)/~â˜†
