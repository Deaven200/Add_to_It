/// Setup Guide for the Teleportation System
/// 
/// ✅ WHAT'S ALREADY DONE:
/// 1. PlayerSpawnManager.cs - Automatically spawns player when teleporting into Main_level
/// 2. ProceduralLevelManager.cs - Updated with SetPlayer() method  
/// 3. MainLevelSetup.cs - Automatically sets up the Main_level scene
/// 4. AutoSetupManager.cs - Automatically adds MainLevelSetup to ProceduralLevelManager
/// 5. TeleportationTest.cs - Test script to verify everything works
/// 
/// 🔧 SETUP STEPS REQUIRED:
/// 
/// Step 1: Add AutoSetupManager to Main_level Scene
/// 1. Open the Main_level scene
/// 2. Create a new GameObject called "AutoSetupManager"
/// 3. Add the AutoSetupManager component
/// 4. Set Player Prefab to your Player prefab (Assets/_Prefabs/Player.prefab)
/// 5. The system will automatically add MainLevelSetup to ProceduralLevelManager
/// 
/// Step 2: Update Teleport Pads
/// 1. In your HubScene or PlayerRoom, find the teleport pad that should go to Main_level
/// 2. Make sure the LevelTeleporter component has:
///    - Level Scene Name = "Main_level"
///    - Time To Teleport = 3 (or your preferred time)
/// 
/// Step 3: Test the System
/// 1. Add the TeleportationTest component to any GameObject in your starting scene
/// 2. Set Test On Start = true to automatically test
/// 3. Or press T to test teleportation manually
/// 
/// 🎮 HOW IT WORKS:
/// 1. Start Game → Player spawns in PlayerRoom ✅
/// 2. Step on TeleportPad → Teleports to Main_level ✅
/// 3. Main_level loads → PlayerSpawnManager automatically spawns player ✅
/// 4. Player can play → Procedural generation works with player ✅
/// 
/// 🔍 DEBUGGING:
/// Console Messages to Look For:
/// - ✅ "AutoSetupManager: Added MainLevelSetup to ProceduralLevelManager"
/// - ✅ "PlayerSpawnManager created for Main_level scene"
/// - ✅ "ProceduralLevelManager found and configured"
/// - ✅ "Player spawned at (0, 10, 0) in Main_level"
/// - ✅ "Player movement enabled!"
/// - ✅ "World ready! Player can now move."
/// 
/// Common Issues:
/// - ❌ "No player prefab assigned!" → Set Player Prefab in MainLevelSetup
/// - ❌ "No ProceduralLevelManager found!" → Check Main_level scene setup
/// - ❌ "Player not on a chunk!" → Wait for terrain generation to complete
/// 
/// 🎯 QUICK TEST:
/// 1. Start from MainMenu → PlayerRoom
/// 2. Step on teleport pad to Main_level
/// 3. Wait 3-5 seconds for terrain generation
/// 4. Player should be able to move around the procedural world!
/// 
/// 🛠️ MANUAL SETUP (if auto-setup fails):
/// If the automatic setup doesn't work:
/// 1. In Main_level scene, create a new GameObject called "PlayerSpawnManager"
/// 2. Add the PlayerSpawnManager component
/// 3. Set the Player Prefab field to your Player prefab
/// 4. Set Spawn Position to (0, 10, 0) or your preferred spawn point
/// 
/// 📝 NOTES:
/// - The player spawns at height 10 to avoid falling through the void
/// - Player movement is disabled for 2 seconds while terrain generates
/// - The system automatically handles scene transitions
/// - All debug logs are minimal for clean console output
